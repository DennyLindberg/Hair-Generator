# Hair generation using geometry shaders

Created by Denny Lindberg for the course TSBK03: Advanced Game Programming.

# Features

- C++17
- For Windows (Visual Studio 2019)
- OpenGL 4.0

# Building the code

Get **premake5** for generating makefiles or solutions for your IDE - https://premake.github.io/download.html

After downloading the executable, place it in the root folder. Run `premake5 vs2019` in the terminal or command line to generate a Visual Studio 2019 solution (the solution ends up in the temp folder). Open the solution and you're good to go.
